Minimum cost path from vertex s in V‚ÇÅ to vertex t in Vùöî
c[i, j] = cost of edge <i,j>
cost(i, j) = min cost from j in V‚Ñπ to t

Forward Approach : cost(i, j) = min {c[j, l] + cost(i+1, l)}
Backward Approach : bcost(i, j) = min {bcost(i-1, l) + c[l, j]}
Time Complexity : œ¥(|V| + |E|)    (graph is represented as adjacency list)

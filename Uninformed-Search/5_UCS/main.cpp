/*
& Uniform Cost Search : Best first search
& Optimal and Complete for non-negative weighted graph
& Priority queue (often min-heap) is used
! Time complexity O(b^(C⋆/ε)) : C⋆ -> cost of optimal solution, ε -> smallest possible edge cost
! Space complexity O(b^(C⋆/ε))
* Logistic and Supply chain management
* Telecommunication Network Design
* AI in Robotics
* Medical Treatment Pathways
* Urban Planning
^ High Memory Usage (Large graph, Dense graph)
^ Slow Performance in Graphs with Uniform Costs (Uniformly Weighted Graphs, Flat Terrain Navigation)
^ Sensitivity to Small Variations in Edge Costs (Graphs with Minor Cost Differences, Network Routing with Variable Costs)
^ Inefficiency in Deep Search Spaces(Deep Decision Trees, Long-Path Planning)

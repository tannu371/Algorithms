* Cultural Heritage and Archaeology
^ 1. Difficulty in Finding a Meeting Point (Irregular Graphs, Sparse Graphs)
^ 2. Increased Memory Usage (Large graphs, Dense graphs)
^ 3. Difficulty in Implementing in Weighted Graphs (Varying weights, Negative weights)
^ 4. Asymmetry in the Search Space (Asymmetric graphs, Skewwd graphs)
^ 5. Not Suitable for All Graph Types (Multiple goals, Non-uniform graph)
^ 6. Coordination and Management Complexity (Real-time Applications, Distributed Systems)
^ 7. Limited Improvement in Small or Simple Graphs
